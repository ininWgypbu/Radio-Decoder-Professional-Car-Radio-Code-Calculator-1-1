## How does it work?
 
The Radio Decoder Professional Car Radio Code Calculator 1.1 works by using the serial number of your radio device to calculate the unique unlock code for it. The serial number is usually located on the label of the radio, either on the back or on one side. You can find it by removing the radio from the dashboard or by checking the manual or the card that came with the radio.
 
Once you have the serial number of your radio, you can enter it in the Radio Decoder Professional Car Radio Code Calculator 1.1 and click on the "Generate" button. The software will then display the unlock code for your radio on the screen. You can also copy the code to the clipboard or save it as a text file for later use.
 
## How to enter the code?
 
To enter the code on your radio device, you need to use the preset buttons on the front panel of the radio. Each button corresponds to one digit of the code. For example, if your code is 1234, you need to press the button 1 repeatedly until the number 1 appears on the display, then press the button 2 repeatedly until the number 2 appears on the display and so on.
 
After you have entered all four digits of the code, you need to confirm it by pressing another button on the radio. This button may vary depending on the model of your radio. For some radios, you need to press and hold the button 6 until you hear a beep sound. For others, you need to press the button 5 once. You can check the specific instructions for your radio model in the manual or online.
